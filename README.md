> **One-command Vite + React + Tailwind CSS v4 starter**

## ğŸ’» What It Does
Creates a ready-to-code project with:
- Vite 6
- React 18
- Tailwind CSS v4
- All configurations pre-set

## Why I Made This
Because setting up these tools manually takes forever! This automates everything in one command.
